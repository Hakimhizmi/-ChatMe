## @ChatMe

This site is similar to Chat GPT in that it receives a user's request, sends it to a Python page for parsing using the OpenAI library, and then responds to the user. The Python page uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to process the user's request and generate a response. With this technology, users can get the information they need quickly and accurately.
